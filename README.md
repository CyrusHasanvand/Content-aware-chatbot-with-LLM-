# Context-Aware LLM Chatbot — ChatChain

ChatChain is a lightweight, modular chatbot framework built on Large Language Models (LLMs) that preserves conversational context. It uses a dynamic prompt-chaining mechanism to summarize and feed prior dialogue into each new request, enabling coherent and memory-rich interactions.

How It Works
- User Input → New message from user
- Summary Engine → Summarizes past conversation
- Prompt Builder → Combines summary + new input
- LLM Response → Generates reply based on full context


## Final code will be updated on this repo in the next few days ahead
